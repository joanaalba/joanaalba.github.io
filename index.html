	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Joana Alba Ferreira Melo. I was born and raised in Sao Paulo Brazil, and have been living in the United States for 14 years. I studied Psychology at Wheaton College and worked for a Children's Hospital for 5 years as a healthcare admnistrator. I then went on to work for a medical educational platform, OPENPediatrics, that conneced physicians from around the world to share knowledge about pediatrics. I am currently changing carreers and will be a student at the Startup Institute Spring class of 2014 in the Product and Design track.</p>
